<h2>Blurbs</h2> 
						<h3>Finding A Way </h3><p>'Finding a Way' is the first single
						and opening track from Sumo's debut album 'Surfacing'. "It's a
						3-minute noisy pop song about probably the most sung about subject
						in pop music, a troubled relationship."</p> <h3>Small Talk</h3> <p>"'Small Talk' is
						the second single from the debut album 'Surfacing'. The song is
						about a breakdown in communication, trying to find the right words
						to fix a situation, but failing. How the most difficult things to
						say to someone are sometimes the most important, how it can never
						seem like the right time to say them and they can end up going
						unsaid."</p> 
                        <h3>Enemies</h3>
						<p>"'Enemies' is the third and final single taken from 'Surfacing', our
						debut album. Musically the song started out very differently, as a
						big 70s rock riff where I was basically ripping off Sheer Mag. Then
						Kyle worked his guitar magic on it and it changed direction. The
						song is loosely about how polarised society feels these days, the
						bad sides of social media and the constant conflict and animosity
						between people and communities."</p>
